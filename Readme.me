🚀 Dockerized Java Application
This project is a beginner-friendly Java application containerized using Docker, developed as part of my learning journey to become a DevOps Engineer. The application prints the current day, date, and time, and runs inside a Docker container on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance.

📌 About the Project
The goal of this project was to understand how to:

Set up and run Docker on a cloud server

Write a functional Dockerfile

Compile and run Java code inside a container

Practice basic DevOps tasks like building and deploying containerized applications

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (OpenJDK 17)

Docker

AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)

Linux Terminal

Vim Editor
